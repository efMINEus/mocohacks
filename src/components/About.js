                Because MoCoHacks was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19, we have decided to run a virtual event this year. MoCoHacks is a MCPS student-run virtual hackathon organized for all MCPS high school students.

                Donâ€™t worry though, we will still be providing all hackers the premiere hackathon experience: FREE SWAG, MERCH, PRIZES, STICKERS, and WORKSHOPS for everyone!
